# Project Euler - Personal Solutions

A collection of code solutions to Project Euler problems.

Solutions are written in Java (on a Java 8 environment).

Note that these are personal solutions that I've came up with as I go through some of the Project Euler problems. It isn't meant to be an archive to check your solutions against. The solution may not always be the most efficient, and multiple solutions may exist within a single class file (under different methods), the efficiency of one over another may be annotated.
